I am an Associate Professor at the School of Intelligence Science and Technology, Nanjing University. My research is currently on visual understanding in an open world, transfer learning, data synthesis and anomaly detection. Previously, I was a senior researcher (T11) in <a href="https://ailab.tencent.com/ailab/en/index/">Tencent AI Lab</a> from 2021 to 2023, and a research scientist in Inception Institute of Artificial Intelligence (IIAI) from 2018 to 2021, where I worked with Prof. <a href="https://shengcailiao.github.io/">Shengcai Liao</a>. I was a research fellow in National University of Singapore (NUS) from 2015 to 2017, co-supervised by Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Q8iay0gAAAAJ&hl=en">Jiashi Feng</a> and Prof. <a href="https://yanshuicheng.info/">Shuicheng Yan</a>. I received my Ph.D. degree from Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA) under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8kzzUboAAAAJ&hl=en">Liang Wang</a>.
